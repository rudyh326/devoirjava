# devoirjava
# I first created my database "demodb" in postgresql then I created a table named "personnes"
# Then I downloaded the JDBC driver for postgresql "postgresql-42.3.1.jar"
# Then I opened Intellij and created my java class "TestJDBC" in a folder I named "devoirjava"
# Then I added the JDBC driver in Intellij py going to "File"->"Project Sructure"->"Modules"->"devoirjava"->"dependencies"->"+"->"JARS or Directories"
# Then I wrote all the java code necessary by checking the web to connect the "demodb" database and to select and paste 
# all elements of the "personnses" table form postgresql in the terminal
